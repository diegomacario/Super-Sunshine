/*
Description:

   The GeometricShape class is the base from which the Triangle and Sphere classes inherit.

   It specifies three pure virtual functions which must be implemented by the classes that inherit from it.
   These functions are common to all geometric shapes, but implemented differently for each type of geometric shape.

   It also provides two common member variables:

   - The ambient illumination.
   - The material.
