Description:

   The Sample class is used to represent the coordinates of the points on the image plane through which we shoot rays from the camera.

   The center of the upper-left pixel has coordinates (0.5, 0.5).
   The center of the upper-right pixel has coordinates (width - 0.5, 0.5)
   The center of the lower-left pixel has coordinates (0.5, height - 0.5)
   The center of the lower-right pixel has coordinates (width - 0.5, height - 0.5)
